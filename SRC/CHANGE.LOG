Changes:

V 1.363 (intermediate)
	example: Added some missing .def files, added examples to makefile
		Improved the output of openptys example
	api, src: renamed XTY_WILLFORK to XTY_ENADUP ioctl, because this
		  ioctl actually notifies the driver of an upcoming dup()/dup2(),
		  which is a side effect of fork().
	src:	Separated FIONBIO for ctrlr and slave (service for
		  EMX emacs)

V 1.362 (intermediate)
	example: Added consel example
		Added openptys example
	bin:	removed
	src:	Fixed a crash with select, select on console should also
		  work now correctly together with select change in emx.dll
		Added WILLFORK ioctl, allows open of master only if enabled
		  with this ioctl first. Post this before a fork()
		Now raises select semaphores if last slave is closed

V 1.354 (1st public beta)
	src:	FIONBIO now also influences reads
		made ioctls somewhat safer, in that they now verify
		  IOPLEN and IODLEN, if DosDevIOCtl2 is used
		change assert_[rw]buf that they accept larger bufsizes
		  than required, so may use on buf and sizeof(buf) in ioctl
		added sending signals SIGINT and SIGBREAK
		added simplified ICANON, ISIG, OPOST processing
		added EOFMODE functionality (untested), allows sending
		  signals on EOF and/or return CTRL-C/D/Z or return 0 bytes;
		  default is 0 bytes and no sig

V 1.331 (limited distribution)
	src:	some changes in assembler proposed by Eberhard
		  (not all: I knew why I did things this way :-)
		added the PMAP_GETROM ioctl to pmap$ to remove requirement
		  for testcfg.sys in SuperProbe
		cleaned up some duplicate prototypes in ttypty.h/util.h
		added version field in *_DRVID ioctl, now possible to
		  verify the version of driver
	api:	some changes in assembler proposed by Eberhard
		fixed a bug in pt_ioctl example code

V 1.323 (limited distribution)
	src:	removed /dev/null
		renamed /dev/console to console$, ptms to ptms$
		fixed some bugs (thanks Eberhard)
		built in *_NAME and *_DRVID interface into all drivers
		renumbered CONS_OWNER ioctl
		renamed XTY_NAME for ptms$ to PTMS_GETPTY
		made all drivers return 0 bytes transferred on READ/WRITE,
		  even if they don't support R/W, rather than RP_EBAD.
		added FIONBIO for write
		added semaphore mechanism for emulation of select()
		improved console IDC (inter DD comminucation)
		map$ and fastio$ now send a warning message to console$,
		  that a process requested the additional features these
		  devices offer
	example:added IOEXAM1.C, IOEXAM2.C
		added PTYEXAM1.C
	bin:	added PTYCTL.C
	api:	see also driver section
		added io_init1()/io_exit1() and friends in gccio1.s
		misc optical stuff in gccio.s
		added console IDC API

V 1.266 first version (limited distribution)
	base functionality

V <1.266 lost in the dark
