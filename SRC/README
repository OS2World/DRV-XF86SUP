This is the source code of the complete xf86sup driver, containing the
following devices:

	/dev/console$
	/dev/pmap$
	/dev/ptms$
	/dev/pty[pq][0-f]
	/dev/tty[pq][0-f]
	/dev/fastio$

In the following, 'code' denotes solely the source and binary code contained
in the files contained in this directory, unless otherwise noted.

Copyrights in the code apply. The code is neither public domain nor
GNU copyleft. However, this driver may be used and distributed without 
restrictions, royalty-free in any public domain, GPL'd (*) or commercial
software in either source or binary form, provided the copyright message
displayed at the beginning remains intact, and the driver code is not torn
apart. (* By using this code with GPL'd or LGPL'd code this driver does
NOT inherit the GNU license rules - if this contradicts to GPL or LGPL,
this code must not be used with such code).
The files in the API directory and the example files in the EXAMPLE directory
are public and may be used or adapted without any restriction.

Commercial users are allowed to *add* further functionality, provided the
existing functionality and APIs remain intact, i.e. the software this drivers 
were written for must still run on such a modified driver. Also the author
reserves the right to extend the driver in the future as well. Side note:
commercial user: you should better not add functions without informing the
author. There are certain stubs in the code that are not yet used, but
are provided for a future extension.

There is also no warranty. Use at your own risk. In no way shall the author(s)
or copyright holders be liable for any damage, financial or other loss, or
lack of functionality promised or implied, by the use of the code.
