The files *os2.h provide the `rawï interface to the driver and may be
used with OS/2 Dos* routines directly.

The files `map.hï, `pty.hï, and `cons.hï and the library `xf86api.aï
provide an interface to access the driver functionality easier, and more
Unix-like. This interface is compatible to emx0.9a, but should be adaptable
without many problems to other 32 bit compilers.

The files `conidc.hï and `conidc.asmï provide a write interface to the
console$ device for device driver writers. It cannot be used by normal user
applications.
